#Stocks

This is a little flask application to show the power of a restful interface. The backend does the heavy lifting getting the stocks data from yahoo finance and calculating the rolling averages. The javascript gets the data from a rest api and creates the plot.


Please, read the code to understand how this works.

To run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
